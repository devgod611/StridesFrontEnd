# Title
------- Front-End Test for Strides Development ------

Requirements:
● Create a simple react app. 
● You can use a scaffolding tool if it helps 
● Use the moviedb api to show a list of movies (api example below) 
● Storing the list in context is a plus, but do not worry if you don’t have time. 
● When you click on the movie title, it should take you to a details page for that specific movie. (api example below) 
● The details page should have a watched toggle that the user can click on and off. You can store this in state or in context. 
● Integrate tailwindUI and add a custom header color for the movie title 
● Create separate components for specific UI elements. 
● Can zip up project and send over to me 
● Not concerned with how the UI looks. If you can use flexbox or css grid to style the list that would be great.
